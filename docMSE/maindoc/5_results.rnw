\section{SIMULATION RESULTS}

\begin{resdoclist}
\item Specifics of simulation, times, what varies
\item Relative performance of MPs
\item Key tuning parameters to yield operational control points where management action is taken (i.e., at what point is effective harvest rate reduced and eventually set to minimum possible)
\item Hierarchy of objectives - the order of priority of objectives in determining viability of an MP
\item Ranking MP performance
\end{resdoclist}
